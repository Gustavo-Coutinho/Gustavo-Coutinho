- 👋 Hello, I am @Gustavo-Coutinho. I take interest on DevOps and platform engineering.
- 👀 I’m interested in infrastructure as code, automation scripts, messaging enginnering and cloud.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning AWS, Kubernetes, Kafka, Cassandra, CI/CD and IBM MQ on a daily basis at work, hands-on. 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on open-source projects to practice my skills learned in the tools mentioned above.
